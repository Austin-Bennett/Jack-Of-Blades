Since last time i uploaded, ive realized it will be very hard to scale and make a game with my last setup, so now I have completely changed the code so that I can create levels using JSON and write a level editor for making levels much easier
Ill be working on getting the player setup as it was last time, most likely ill focus on player animations and such a lot aswell
